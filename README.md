This is a computer game in which you control a hero who can move on a 2-dimensional map, collect various objects and enter battles with different monsters.

The hero has different characteristics and can collect, carry and use varoius objects.

The game consists of different levels through which the hero can move. Every level is a 2-dimensional map, similar to a chess board but with an arbitrary size.

The hero can move up, down, left and right on the map. The cells can be passable or impassable(e.g a wall).

The map for a given level looks like this:

In the map the symbol '_' shows the location of the hero, the symbol '_' shows the location of an object/treasure, the symbols '_' denote walls, the symbols '_' denote monsters and the symbols '_' denote the places on which you can save the current state of the game. The symbol '_' denotes the passage that leads to the next level (next map).

The game allows saving the current state (hero characteristics, his location, what objects they carry, etc.)
